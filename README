I built this application to create a template MVC 'style' app that I could then use as the start point for further development.  I used the excellent examples in the main Express github (https://github.com/visionmedia/express) repository, specifically the MVC example, as the starting point.  I have however changed it quite substantially to make it clearer and remove some of the 'magic' that confused me at first when learning.  If you are familiar with other MVC frameworks hopefully my file structure makes some sense.

IMPORTANT:
 
I've now switched the ORM to Sequelizer, for my use cases Mongoose and Mongo just didn't make any sense, most of my problems are relational and it just didn't make sense to fight it any longer!  I've saved the last working copy of the framework with Mongoose in the 'mongoose' branch, feel free to take it forward if you wish, I will no longer be doing anything with it.
  
It depends on:

You need to manually install: 

* http://nodejs.org/ Node.js: Amazing javascript asynchronous IO library, install manually.
* http://dev.mysql.com MySQL: Database, install manually.
* http://npmjs.org/ NPM: Node package manager, used to install the remaining.

And then install via NPM: 

* http://expressjs.com/ Express: Application Framework for Node.js
* http://embeddedjs.com/ ejs: EmbeddedJS Templating

But I've included in this project:

* http://sequelizejs.com/ Sequelizer: Node.JS ORM for MySQL - included as I want to keep it on the devel version for now.
* http://jquery.com/ jQuery: Javascript Library
* http://jqueryui.com/ jQuery UI: UI Library
